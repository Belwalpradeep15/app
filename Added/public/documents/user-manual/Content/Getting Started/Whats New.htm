        <h1>What's New in Panoptes V15.0</h1>
        <h2>Aggregated Panoptes</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This feature allows the Panoptes software to be used to roll up a number of other Panoptes units into a network wide summary view for larger systems.</p>
        <h3>Detailed description</h3>
        <p>At the Helios level the Panoptes software functions in exactly the same way, but it is now possible to connect a particular Panoptes to multiple other Panoptes units instead of connecting to Helios units. This essentially creates a hierarchy of Panoptes systems to create an aggregated view of the status of a large installation. The Aggregated Panoptes provides the ability to monitor up to 50 Helios units spread across 20 local Panoptes units. Alarms from each of the local Panoptes units will be displayed on the Aggregated Panoptes on a geographical map view or engineering diagram, as they are detected. Alarms can be interrogated but any actions associated with Alarm processing must be performed at the local Panoptes. The Aggregated Panoptes can import fibre line and route configurations from the local Panoptes during configuration.</p>
        <p>Network topology example:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">

        </p>
        <p>New screens have been added to allow lower level Panoptes units to be added to an Aggregated Panoptes. It is not possible to connect Panoptes and Helios units at the same time.</p>
        <p>Fibre lines and routes are imported from the local Panoptes units via a cloning facility on the Aggregated Panoptes UI. Fibre lines and routes from multiple local Panoptes are appended to each other.</p>
        <p>Alarm types can be imported from a local Panoptes unit by exporting to a file and importing into the Aggregated Panoptes. Note that only one file can be imported at a time, if a second file is imported it will overwrite the current settings.</p>
        <p>Organisations, users, markers and other settings can all be configured on the Aggregated Panoptes via the UI.</p>
        <p>Configuration change at the Aggregated Panoptes are not reproduced at the local level and hence should be avoided to prevent data alignment issues occurring.</p>
        <p>At start up the Aggregated Panoptes will interrogate any connected Panoptes units for the current Alarm list and status. New alarms will be reported to the Aggregated Panoptes and added to its display. Alarms can only be processed on the local Panoptes unit, actions such as Acknowledge and Resolve are disabled at the Aggregated Panoptes. Events are not reported up to the Aggregated Panoptes, these are only maintained on the local Panoptes units.</p>
        <p>Aggregated Panoptes provides a Portal view with the same functionality as the local level, apart from Alarm processing.</p>
        <p>Aggregated Panoptes shall provide status reports on the health and connectivity of connected Panoptes and Helios units.</p>
