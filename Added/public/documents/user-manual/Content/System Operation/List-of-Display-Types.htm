        <h1>List of Display Types</h1>
        <h2>Default</h2>
        <p>The Default display type has been designed to respond to any valid signal disturbance that occurs between DC Cut-off and Nyquist (the full frequency range as defined by the PRF).  It does not require an active Detection Statistic from an active Alarm Report.  The advantage of the Default display type is that it shows the fibre sensorâ€™s response to disturbances as a function of distance without an active Alarm Report.</p>
        <h2>Acoustic</h2>
        <p>The Acoustic display type is provided to assist you when you want to log acoustic data. You will need to use this display in combination with the controls found in the Acoustic Tab of the Optical Channel Properties dialog. When you are satisfied that the display signal is as high as you can get it without there being too much clipping, you will be ready to log the acoustic data.</p>
        <h2>Raw Fibre Shot</h2>
        <p>This displays the raw digitized data that comes in directly from the optics module, as a function of distance.  The raw data contains values between zero (0) and 32,768. 

In addition, all of the previous data display types are derived from the power spectra of the input signal, and all have an update rate equal to the FFT update rate.  

The raw data comes in at the PRF, which is at a much higher update rate.  When the raw fibre shot is displayed, the system simply takes the first fibre shot of every FFT block, and sends that raw fibre shot to the  display. No temporal averages occur in the data reduction.</p>
        <h2>Mean Fibre Shot</h2>
        <p>The Mean Fibre Shot display shows the mean value (or DC component) of the fibre response at each fibre location over the FFT interval.  It is very similar to the Raw Signal display, but updates much slower (at the FFT update rate rather than the PRF).  This display type shows variations of the non-time varying fibre response (over the duration of an FFT block) as a function of distance. This response closely reflects the ambient response of the fibre sensor at each sample point. </p>
        <h2>Mean Fibre Shot Drift</h2>
        <p>This displays the amplitude variation of the Mean Fibre Shot (also known as the DC Baseline) between FFT blocks as a function of distance.  Theoretically, there should be very little drift over time, as the DC Baseline is the fibre response in the absence of any physical excitation, but in reality any physical system will contain some drift. This display allows you to obtain an indication of just how much drift exists.</p>
        <h2>Noise Floor</h2>
        <p>This display provides an indication of the currently estimated noise floor of the system. This display also shows that model as a line graph. This display is mostly used when tuning the noise floor bounds model to suit the needs of a specific installation.</p>
        <h2>Signal RMS</h2>
        <p>This displays the time series Root Mean Square (RMS) of the time samples, over an FFT block due to signal power only, with the band limited to the analysis band.  </p>
        <h2>Noise RMS</h2>
        <p>This is very similar to the Signal RMS value except that it is the time series RMS over an FFT block due to noise power only, band limited to the analysis band.</p>
        <h2>Total RMS</h2>
        <p>This displays the time series RMS over an FFT block that includes signal and noise power, with the band limited to the analysis band. </p>
        <h2>Stream Detection Value</h2>
        <p>This displays the Detection Statistic for a particular stream.  This value is a pseudo Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the response of the fibre, with the band limited to the analysis band. 

This value is computed in two stages:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The raw Detection Statistic is computed if the spectral processing properties is assigned to a particular stream.  
</li>
            <li>The raw Detection Statistic is optionally de-smeared if the Detection Statistic Half-life is assigned to a particular stream.  The Stream Detection Value is used as input for the Alarm Threshold module, which generates the Stream Indicators.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Stream Indicators</h2>
        <p>As described above in Stream Detection Value, raw indicators exist when the Alarm Detection Value falls within a user-defined amplitude range.  

All time and space points with Alarm Detection Values above the Alarm detection threshold, and below the Alarm suppression threshold, will produce a raw indicator.  These raw indicators can be cleaned to remove false positive and false negative values.  

</p>
        <p>Cleaned indicators are displayed with this data display type, as it optimizes the Alarm detection threshold and the Indicator Cleaning properties, to produce a solid stream of cleaned indicators. These appear where disturbances of interest are located.</p>
        <p>

Stream Indicators are input into the Alarm Reporting module, and without properly conditioned indicators, the probability of robust alarms on desired disturbances is greatly diminished.
</p>
        <h2>Alarm Indicators</h2>
        <p>An Alarm Report can consist of multiple streams, each with a set of Stream Indicators associated with it.  

</p>
        <p>This display type shows the Boolean combination of the cleaned indicators, which are used as input into the Alarm Reporting module.  This is very helpful if you have to fine-tune the Boolean logic, which is used if you combine individual streams being fed into the Alarm Report logic. </p>
