        <h1>Configuring Threat Accumulator Profiles</h1>
        <p>Alarms are one or more events of a given event type (walking, digging, etc.) that —based on event frequency within a certain time period— generate a threat level. Threat levels are classified as either clear, green, amber, or red. Configure Panoptes to assign various threat levels based on the type and volume of events.</p>
        <p>If you have Panoptes V14.0 or later software the threat accumulator can be configured and forwarded to any associated Helios units, so that the Helios unit can monitor threats and generate alarms directly. The Helios unit typically has more processing power than the Panoptes unit and is geographically closer to the fibre, so some installations may benefit from this configuration.</p>
        <p>After the first push of the threat accumulator configuration from Panoptes to Helios, the configuration stays automatically synchronized when you change the configuration using Panoptes.</p>
        <p>Threat accumulation can still occur on the Panoptes unit to support Helios units with older software versions that don't support threat-driven logging, and also where the Helios threat accumulation isn't enabled on a unit. When the Panoptes unit is notified of a threat by the Helios unit, it stops threat accumulation for that Helios unit.</p>
        <h2>To configure alarms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the Panoptes <b>Admin</b> menu, click <b>Alarm Configurations</b>. The <a href="Alarm Configurations.htm">Alarm Configurations</a> dialog appears.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <i>Event Alarms</i> pane, click <b>New Alarm Configuration</b> (<img src="../Resources/Images/add.png" />) to display the <i>New Alarm Configuration</i> dialog , where you select from the various event types configured on the Helios unit for which to set an alarm.<br />To apply a generic threat level profile, at the bottom of the newly added event type column, click <strong>Apply Template</strong> (<img src="../Resources/Images/Apply Template.png" />) to write its settings to the event type column. This can give you a starting point to customize.</li>
            <li value="3">Using the <em>Event Alarms</em> dialogue, select an event type and then define what number of incidents of this event constitute a green, amber, or red alert. </li>
            <li value="4">Following are some fundamental guidelines:
                    <ul><li><i>Counting Period</i> - sets the period for which to collect events before processing them as potential alarms. Each time the Counting Period is reached, the events that occurred since the last iteration of the Counting Period are processed.</li><li><i>Counting Width</i> - half of the distance on either side of an event within which another event is considered as related. </li><li><i>Decrement</i> - number of events to remove from the event pool when an iteration of the Counting Period is reached and no new events have occurred. Think of this and the Counting Period as controlling an accumulator with decay.</li><li><i>Thresholds</i> - Amber, Red, and Green are labels, each of which includes some static routines. For example, the Amber level includes options for hysteresis and clearance that enable an event to quickly be scaled up or down. And the Red level cannot automatically be de-escalated without human intervention. Count thresholds are triggers that are used to control the increment to apply.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="5">Using the <em>Enable Alarms</em> pane, configure how the threat accumulator processes the event pool in order to escalate and de-escalate threats.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the configuration is complete, you have the option to send the configuration file to the Helios unit, so that threat accumulation can occur on the Helios unit. To do so, click <b>Send to Helios units</b> at the bottom of the <i>Alarm Configurations</i> dialog. Using the Helios unit, you need to specifically assign the <i>Threat Accumulation</i> and <i>Threat Logging</i> tasks to the Helios unit. For details on this step, refer to the Helios help documentation.</p>
