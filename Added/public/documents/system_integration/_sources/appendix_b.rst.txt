Appendix B: System Alarms
=========================
These alarms are generated by our watchdog and indicate a problem with the overall system. All system alarms have a
ThreatLevel of 'red' and are automatically resolved by the system when the alarm condition is no longer present. While a
user can resolve these alarms manually (like an event based alarm) there is little point in doing so as, assuming the
condition that let to the alarm still exists, a new one will be generated.

The following are the
possible system alarms that can be generated on a standard configuration:

* Panoptes: This signifies a problem with an internal component of the Panoptes system or an inability to communicate with another Panoptes system.
* Helios: This signifies that we are unable to communicate with a Helios system. This alarm may also have a Geospatial setting if one has been configured for the Helios unit.
* Cabinet: This signifies a problem with a cabinet (a rack). At present there are two things that this may indicate, a problem with a high temperature, or the inability to communicate with the temperature sensor.
* Communications: Assuming the rack has been configured with a suitable network switch (or switches) this can indicate the inability to communicate with the network switch or the failure of the communications line between two network switches.
